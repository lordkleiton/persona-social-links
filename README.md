# Persona 3 Social Links

Hunting down for guides on how to max rank a specific Social Link in the Persona Series can be quite a drag sometimes.

Now you can get a spoiler-free guide on which option you should pick in a conversation.

For now, this cheatsheet only contains the Social Links present on Persona 3, but I hope to be able to complete all of them (P3, P4 and P5).

## Why?

Because I could and never asked myself if I should

Actually, I really like playing persona and most sites that host these guides are really slow, full of tracking and, most annoyingly, obscenelly filled with UNSKIPPABLE VIDEO ADS (looking especially at you, wikia)

Finally, I wanted to practice Typescript

## L-Links...?

## It looks ugly...

P-please don't be so harsh...

Really, I love these kinds of ultra-barebones looks. It reminds me of old JRPGs, especially the first generations of Pok√©mon.

It's an acquired taste, thank you very much

## How can I help you?

Dunno, but thanks for asking

## Where'd you get the answers for the link ranks?

## Some of the dialog is actually wrong

It'd make me really glad if you open an issue with the correct dialog and point me to the problem
